                    <p>
                        Molly Papirnik founded Jack & Jill School in the dining room of her home on Nightingale Road with one boy and one girl, offering traditional education in the home from home environment that she felt to be of paramount importance. This is Nightingale House in Hampton where Reception to Year Two are based.

                        Mrs Papirnik initially managed everything single handed, but with the rapid growth of her school, extra assistance was required. Hence, she appointed her first teacher, Elsie, who remained with her for 30 years before a well-earned retirement on the South coast. Molly continued collecting and dropping of pupils in her car, which she nicknamed Mildred, at the beginning and end of the day for many years.
